# Lightweight Stereo VIO

This is a lightweight stereo visual-inertial odometry (VIO) project designed for real-time performance. It utilizes feature tracking, IMU pre-integration, sliding window optimization with Ceres Solver, and Pangolin for visualization.

## Project Structure

The source code is organized into the following directories:

- `app/`: Main application entry points
- `src/`:
  - `database/`: Data structures for `Frame` (including IMU data), `MapPoint`, and `Feature`
  - `processing/`: Core VIO modules, including `Estimator`, `FeatureTracker`, `IMUHandler`, and `Optimizer`
  - `optimization/`: Ceres Solver cost functions for visual reprojection errors and IMU pre-integration constraints
  - `viewer/`: Pangolin-based visualization
  - `util/`: Utility functions for configuration and data loading
- `thirdparty/`: External libraries (Ceres, Pangolin, Sophus, spdlog)
- `config/`: Configuration files for VO and VIO modes
- `docs/`: Detailed documentation guides
